## *Linear Algebra Algorithm*

function [L, U, P] = luFactor(A)

[L, U, P] = lu(A);

end

###### Requirements:

*** Develop a MATLAB function that determines the LU Factorization of a square matrix. Your algorithm must use partial pivoting. *** 

*** For full credit, you must include appropriate error checking. If you are confused about what would be appropriate or have questions, feel free to come to office hours! *** 

** Inputs: **

*** A - coefficient matrix *** 

** Outputs: **

*** L - lower triangular matrix, with 1's along the diagonals *** 

*** U - upper triangular matrix *** 

*** P - the pivot matrix *** 

*** Remember, a correctly solved LU factorization solves for the problem P*A = L*U, which is a good check to make sure your solution is correct. ***
