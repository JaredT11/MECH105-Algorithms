## *Binary Converter*

function [base2] = binaryConverter(base10)

nb = 2;

sum = base10;

reminder = 0;

i = 1;

base2 = 0;

while sum > 0

reminder = mod(sum,nb);

sum = floor(sum./nb);

base2(i) = reminder;

i = i+1;

end

base2 = flip(base2)

end

###### Requirements:

***One input: the number in base 10 (a.k.a. decimal, or "normal numbers", as in "I have 237 apples")***

***One output: an array of the input converted to base 2 (a.k.a. binary, as in "beep boop I am a robot, I counted 11101101 apples")***
