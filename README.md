# MECH105-Algorithms
These are the Algorithms that I have created for Mech105 utilizing different numerical methods.

***1 - Homework 2_Part 1 [Simple Electrical Circuit]***

***2 - Homework 2_Part 2 [Degradation of Aqueous Bromide]***

***3 - Homework 3 [Decisions]***

***4 - Homework 5 [Matrices]***

***5 - Homework 6.5 [Binary Converter]***

***6 - Homework 11 [Root Finding]***

***7 - Homework 17 [Linear Algebra Algorithm]***

***8 - Homework 22 [Simpsons 1/3 Algorithm]***

**I wasn't able to find my algoithms from the homeworks just because my computer files decided to bug out.**

*I have included each and every algorithms from the MatlabGrader into it's own seperate folders. Containing Homework's 2.1 ,2.2 ,3 ,5 ,6.5 ,11 ,17 ,and 22.*

*Each file will explain what the Homework requires to solve and the code is what I used to successfully execute those problems!*
