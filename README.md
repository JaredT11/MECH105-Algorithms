# MECH105-Algorithms
These are the Algorithms that I have created for Mech105 utilizing different numerical methods.

***1 - Homework 2_Part 1***

***2 - Homework 2_Part 2***

***3 - Homework 3***

***4 - Homework 5***

***5 - Homework 6.5***

***6 - Homework 11***

***7 - Homework 17***

***8 - Homework 22***

**I wasn't able to find my algoithms from the homeworks just because my computer files decided to bug out.**

*I have included each and every algorithms from the MatlabGrader into it's own seperate folder. Containing Homework's 2.1 ,2.2 ,3,5 ,6.5 ,11 ,17 ,and 22*

*Each file will explain what the Homework problem is explaining and the code is what I used to successfully execute those problems!*
