###### Requirements:

***Write a function that returns a n x m matrix with elements that have the following values.*** 

***The value of each element in the first row is the number of the column.*** 

***The value of each element in the first column is the number of the row.*** 

***The rest of the elements each has a value equal to the sum of the element above it and element to the left.*** 

***The function must return a sensible error if the user does not input exactly two arguments*** 

***The function should be well commented***
