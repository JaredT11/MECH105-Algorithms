###### Requirements:

***Use the bisect function in your script file. It is included in Matlab Grader and can be called using***

***Where the function inputs and outputs are the same as in the flase position algorithm.***

***Finally, your script should include a of fprintf statement(s) which should print out the the value selected as the root,
how many iterations the method took, what the approximate error is and what f is evaluated at the root. Use the default values of the function when you can.***
